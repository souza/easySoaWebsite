		<h3>What is the Partner Entreprise Program ?</h3>

		In a nusthell: share your SOA issues with us, we'll extend EasySOA to
		address the most interesting ones and make it available back in Open
		Source.<br /> <br /> The Partner Entreprise Program is open to French
		companies. It involves signing a two-way contract with Open Wide.
		Though this contract is not ready as of yet (August 2011), we have
		gone forward on mutual trust with a selection of our existing
		customers, resulting in several submitted use cases and some planned
		developments already.

		<h3>Partner Entreprises</h3>

		Here are the partner entreprises, their business domain and the kind
		of SOA issues they are interested to submit.<br />

		<h3>More about the Partner Entreprise Program </h3>
		The Partner Entreprise
		Program is a &#147; from the trenches &#148;, &#147; guerilla &#148; approach to identify
		& address the most common needs & use cases, around the project core &#150;
		that is, at our own companies, our clients, our communities, by simply
		getting known people that trust us to submit their SOA&#150;themed issues.
		In full reciprocity, we'll enrich EasySOA to address the most
		promising and useful ones, and share our developments back in Open
		Source, free for you to test and use at any scale. However we won't
		prevent you to buy custom service & development if you want any :
		installation on your own servers, configuration, further custom
		developments. In a word, it's feature-driven development &#150; the Open
		Source way, no more, no less. And we're betting that we're able to
		provide good enough tools for them thanks to EasySOA &#150; and that you
		have good enough ideas ! &#150; so that you'll find it all impossible to
		pass on, work with it daily and start paying for the business or
		solution specific requests that would REALLY scale up the benefits in
		your own entreprise. So <a class="index-link" href="mailto:easysoa-dev@googlegroups.com">join us</a> !
