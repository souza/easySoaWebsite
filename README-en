DATABSE
	
	Windows
		- Install EasyPHP
		- Create a database named easysoasimplified
		- Change your pom file in modifying the port by 3306 
		
	Mac

For the first launch, when you will create an account, you will have an error because tables wil be created at this moment so, the Town table is not initialized, and the creation form doesn't work. 
So you have to load the Town.sql script in the database to initialize this table. 
For that, use the tab at the top of the database manager in the database easysoasimplified.
After that, you can reload the account creation.
